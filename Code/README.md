# STEPS FOR RUNNING THE CODE

1. Set the root working directory to */Code* (for example, *'/home/ubuntu/Final-Project-Group1/Code'*)
2. Run *main.py*
3. Check the *outputs* directory for results

*main.py* runs everything. It fetches the data from the remote source, it does the polygon to png image conversions, it does train/test/splits, and runs all three of the models that we curated for meaningful outputs.
