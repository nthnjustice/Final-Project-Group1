# STEPS FOR RUNNING THE CODE

1. Set the working directory to *[~]/Code* (for example, *'/home/ubuntu/Final-Project-Group1/Code'*)
2. Run *main.py*
3. Check the *outputs* directory for results

*main.py* runs everything. It fetches the data from remote sources, converts geospatial polygons into png images, handles train/validation/test splits, and runs all three of the selected models.
